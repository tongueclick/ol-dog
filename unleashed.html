<div style="font-size: 14px;"><p><span style="font-weight: 900;">This ol' dog</span> was born in Canada, and raised in a sturdy mud hut in Central America by my adventurous parents. After several years of close encounters with my three fantastical siblings, I was unleashed back to Canada, where I now reside with my Lady and our two lil’ hurricanes. Having a soft spot for the great outdoors, I’m out to mark my territory whenever possible. Somedays, I like to catch up on a favorite fantasy or thriller novel. The tumultous upbringing of a third-world culture keeps things grounded, even with primal vices like single malts and stinky cheeses lurking around every corner.
<p><span style="font-weight: 900">Being employed</span> at a large telco has gleamed special communications skills, such as disabling the telephone after getting home from work.
<p><span style="font-weight: 900">Periodic obsession</span> is tongue.click, a little website built on an impulse to challenge myself on building a website.
<p><span style="font-weight: 900">In the event</span> of being bearded today, but clean-shaven tomorrow, my eternal gratitude goes to the many people whom have made my life a totality. In order of importance, they are: Better half, little halves, first bloods, second bloods, inlaws, outlaws, old friends, new friends and lost friends, teachers Julie, Max and Cheryl, former boss El Capitan, barber Tony, various colleagues, and the random strangers throughout my duties that have shared their bread, troubles, and experiences.<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 900">Slightly morbid?</span> Yes. Just embrace it.
<p><span style="font-weight: 900">~ Favorite Quotes ~</span><br>
• Anytime you see a turtle up on top of a fence post, you know he had some help. - Alex Haley<br>
• If your short of trouble, take a goat.<br>
<span style="font-weight: 900">This one’s good</span> too:<br>
• A politician wouldn’t say it’s crap even if he had a mouth full of it. - John Oakley, Talk Radio AM 640
<p><span style="font-weight: 900">~ Favorite Film Lines ~</span><br>
• What a f*cking day. - Al Pacino, Heist<br>
• Release the baby! - The Croods</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 900">And so</span>, this just about concludes that. With that I end with this: Whether we dance in fame, walk in plain sight, or swim in obscurity, can’t we all just get a bone? Woof!</p></div></span></li>
